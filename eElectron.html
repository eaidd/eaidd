<p><h1><B>Quantum Mechanical Calculation Method of the All Electronic Structure of Protein</B></h1></p>		
<pre><h2>

We created a method of calculating binding sites of protein-drug using quantum mechanics. This method 
started with the method of J. Ladik and YJ Ye, but their method can be calculated a very small protein only.
We extended it to arbitrarily large proteins and combined the calculation with hydrophobic pockets,frontal 
orbital perturbations and established three necessary and sufficient rules to determine the active pocket
,active residue and active atoms.

The program uses the divide-and-conquer algorithm of calculus idea to recursively decompose a complex problem
into many related sub-problems. These sub-problems are independent of each other,and it has the same characteristics 
as the original problem, so we can use the solutions of these small sub-problems to get the solutions to the 
original larger problems. First, the entire chain of a protein is divided into many dimers, each of which 
contains two amino acid residues. Next, we perform first principles on all dimers quantum computing, and use 
the solution of each dimer to construct a large complete Hamiltonian matrix. But this large complete Hamiltonian 
matrix is ​​close to the diagonal of the block,therefore, we can use ENFC theorem in mathematics to obtain eigenvalues.

The effect of the solution must be considered. Place a few atoms at the end of each dimer to simulate the chemical
environment in which the dimer is located. And from the pdb file of the experimental protein lacks hydrogen atoms
and some atoms. We must run the NAMD program to add hydrogen and lack atoms and run it to 300K room temperature.
    
The protein molecule system is so large that its energy levels are extremely compact. We need to extend the definition
of the frontier orbitals of proteins to HOMOs and LUMOs,it is not limited to a single HOMO and LUMO. For example, 
the protease RdRp has 52,130 electrons, and the number of orbitals occupied is NOCC = 26,065. It has a total of 851
residues,so we divide it into 851 dimers and use 20 tracks as LUMOs, which is only 0.000767 of the total tracks.
   
Finally, how to determine the three necessary and sufficient conditions for the active residue or active atom of 
the protein in the protein-ligand interaction using our three necessary and sufficient rules.
     
After quantum computing, we can put the active pockets, active atoms and all candidate small molecule drugs into 
the artificial intelligence deep learning 3D-CNN program to calculate the binding affinity.
